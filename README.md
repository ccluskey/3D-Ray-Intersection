# Description
Set of scripts to determine the closest point of intersection between two rays.

Also, some basic matrix tools (determinant, inverse).

I'm using these scripts in Unity, but they could be used in any C# project that deals with 3d rays

## Why not just use colliders?
The main reason is I wanted some practice with vectors in 3 dimensions.

However, this also has the advantage of returning data about how close the two rays are if they don't intersect (which they almost always don't!). I'm planning on using this data as a mechanic in my game.
